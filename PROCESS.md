Process
1. I wrote down all the nouns and verbs in each user story and then I made a table where I organised them into objects and messages.
2. My objects were: plane, airport, air traffic controller
3. My messages were: landing, taking off.
4. For the first user story I made a class called Airport and a method called land.
5. I wrote feature tests in irb that initially failed. I wrote some code so that my feature tests passed. My unit tests tested for the existence of my class and whether an instance of my class responds to my landing method.
6. Once my code passed I wrote feature tests.
